# building_nano_gpt


## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a minimal yet functional GPT model from scratch using PyTorch. The project is an ongoing endeavor that will eventually incorporate the implementation of a non-trivial research paper, further expanding the complexity and depth of the project. By doing so, I aim to demonstrate my ability to dive deep into a specific topic and showcase my expertise in transformer-based models.
