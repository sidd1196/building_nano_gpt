# building_nano_gpt


## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a minimal yet functional GPT model from scratch using PyTorch. The project is an ongoing endeavor that will eventually incorporate the implementation of a non-trivial research paper, further expanding the complexity and depth of the project. By doing so, I aim to demonstrate my ability to dive deep into a specific topic and showcase my expertise in transformer-based models.



## Features:
- Nano GPT Model: A simple but functional implementation of a GPT-like model.
- Character-Level Language Modeling: Training the model on text data at the character level to predict the next character in a sequence.
- Tokenizer Implementation: Custom character encoding and decoding functions.
- Training Loop: Optimized using AdamW with training and validation loss monitoring.
- Text Generation: Text generation function to sample from the trained model.
- Implementing SparseAttention.


## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the [YouTube video by Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=13), which provides a detailed walkthrough of implementing a simple transformer model. His work and explanations laid the foundation for building this minimal GPT model.


## Future Work:

- Research Paper Implementation: I am implementing a more complex and cutting-edge research paper related to transformer models or generative AI to deepen the projectâ€™s scope. This will include adaptations of the core model and algorithm improvements based on state-of-the-art methods.

- Fine-tuning for Specific Tasks: Applying the model to specific text generation tasks and fine-tuning it on specialized datasets.

- Evaluation and Optimization: Measuring the performance of the model and optimizing it for speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency.

- Extended Documentation: Provide in-depth explanations of the inner workings of each component in the codebase, including architecture decisions, model layers, and optimization techniques.
